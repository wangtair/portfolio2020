          <h2>Portfolio 1 - [MI 231 Final Project] Angle Warrior</h2>
          <div class="description">
            <p>This is the Final Project of the MI 231 class at the College of ComArtSci at MSU. For this project, I worked with my teammate Issac who is a very talented person at coding. Because I am not a good gamer on this game, I just set the live as "negative 20" in order to pass the whole game in the video.</p>
            <p>Because I just have few months of experience as coding and he is much experienced than me, I worked as assistant. The main game mechanic designs are created by Issac and I worked as assistant for him. We discussed the opinions of design of the game and I used to help him comming up with ideas. I have always helped him with ideas and detection to figure out problems. As an assistant, I also helped him with some separate game settings and some enemy production. I have designed an enemy with propeller and the final boss.</p>
            <p>The source of the boss is from some boss in Gradius. The final boss has two stages. Player has to defeat all of its four limbs first. After that, the core will be activated and player is able to hit it. The core is able to shoot a purple projectile which cannot be blocked by the shield. As the HP of the core is less than a half, it will change color from blue to red. </p>
            <p>This project is the first time doing large amounts of coding on my own for my part. Thanks to the help from Issac and Professor Jeremy Bond, this project gets a good effect. </p>
