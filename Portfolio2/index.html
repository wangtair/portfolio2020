          <h2>Portfolio 2 - Zhongguancun High School Student Adventure</h2>
          <div class="description">
            <p>This is a game I have created by Unreal during the Fall 2017 semester when I was studying at Seton Hall University. This is the final game project for the game design and development course. The main mechanic of this system is the Unreal Bluescreen. </p>
            <p>Because the professor rarely taught skills about coding or Bluescreen, nearly all of the skills and system production are learned from online tutorials just as what he asked us to do. The tutorials are mainly some 2D platformer game tutorials on the YouTube where I got lots of techniques of coding the basic mechanics. The “attack function” got some help from the professor. </p>
            <p>All of the sprites, backgrounds, and level designs are created by my own. Some of the sprites are the old sprites I created before. All of the sprites are directly created by Windows Paint Tool. This skill is stimulated from some sprites on the Spriters Resource website. The background image of the mountain is synthesized by a real photo of the Inner Mongolia. </p>
            <p>The game design source is referred to Metroidvania. Some of the stage traps are inspired by “I Wanna to be the Guy” series game due to lack of coding technique. Many of the mechanics of enemy, trap and object movement are directly from animation.</p>
