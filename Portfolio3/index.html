          <h2>Portfolio 3 - Self-Made Maze Game by Power Point</h2>
          <div class="description">
            <p>This video shows the demo of a “game” created by Microsoft PowerPoint when I was training my English in an English education institute in 2014. I just got some inspiration of some of my classmates and then I started creating it. </p>
            <p>In this game, player plays as a mouse and the mouse will try to walk through the maze to reach the “Goal”. Once the mouse touched objects such as walls, traps or monsters, the player dies and need to restart the current level. There are different environments and special settings in different stages. The whole game is created by hyperlinks, animation effects and page switches inside PowerPoint.</p>
            <p>With more stages finished, there became more types of plays and settings. There are totally 10 stages in this game. Some sprites are created by Windows Paint. </p>
